# advanced-css-natours

Natours is a fictional company that offers guided nature tours. I used this site as a way to practice advanced css skills.

Technology and Techniques Used:
- Sass: Variables and Nesting
- 7-1 CSS Architecture
- Custom Grid using floats
- CSS Animations
- Responsive design
- Media queries
- Responsive images
- Browser support
- NPM scripts

This project was created with the help of the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course; [Advance CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)
